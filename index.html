        <p>Adopt the use of eco-friendly cleaners, cause detergents containing phosphate lead to the death of aquatic organisms and algae bloom. On the other hand, environmentally friendly detergents still do the work of cleaning your clothes while minimizing harm to the rivers and oceans.When we pollute water resources, we’re not only causing harm to the water bodies but putting lots of useful resources to waste. For instance, every tonne of domestic water supplied to our homes undergo costly treatment. So, practice water conservation to protect water. Embrace the tradition of taking a shower rather than bathing. Don’t leave your water running. Also, dump the addiction to washing your clothes every day.While the use of pesticides and herbicides as pests and weeds control might be helpful to your home and agriculture, it’s quite damaging to water bodies. When it rains, these chemicals are sucked by the ground, consequently poisoning groundwater, thus, polluting drinking water and the environment.
            Employ other safe means of controlling pests like the use of biological methods that involve using the natural antagonists of these pests.If you’re a gun enthusiast, minimize the amount of time you spend at a rifle range. It may feel good to carry around an AR-15 rifle, which you can fold easily to your target practice session, but there’s more to that guilty pleasure. There are many contaminants associated with gun use that can make their way into the groundwater and, in turn, affect human health. So, the lesser you visit these gun ranges, the lazier the contaminants travel.The dumping of household items into the restroom is one bad habit that fosters pollution. For instance, dumping toilet paper into the latrine infects local water with chlorine which is, a chemical that lends tissue paper its white color. So, properly get rid of your tissue paper, rags, and other cleaning disposables after use.Car and other means of transportation lacking proper maintenance spill oil quickly. This oil would then escape into groundwater.
            Such a mishap is avoidable if you properly maintain your vehicles. This preventative measure also discourages air pollution, which worsens water pollution.</p>
